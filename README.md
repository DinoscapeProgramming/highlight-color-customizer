### Developer
The main developer is Dinoscape (so me lol). I sometimes found it annoying when I saw the standard blue color if I selected some text. So, I made a friendly extension, which allows you to change the highlight color of your browser. It's mainly developed for Chrome, but it'll probably also work in other browsers. Have fun!
